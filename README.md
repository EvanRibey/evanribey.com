# Website

The homepage for my website. This website is built as a quick one pager with links to my other profiles. The site acts as more of a stepping stone to work off of for future incorporations and updates.

Future updates are to include my portfolio, and other probjects that I have worked on, as well as a more extensive information page, and contact page.

# Framework
The website is built using the NuxtJS framework which uses VueJS as a front end website builder. It's fairly lightweight and will allow me to build more off of the website going forward.
