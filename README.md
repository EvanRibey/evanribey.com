# Website

The homepage for my website. This website is built as a quick one pager with links to my other profiles. The site acts as more of a stepping stone to work off of for future incorporations and updates.

Future updates are to include my portfolio, other projects that I worked on, a more extensive information page, and contact page.

# Framework
The website is built using the starting Vue v3 Typescript starter from vite. I don't need anything too complex given the nature of the site and its contents.
